- `journal` 
	- each file acts as a scratchpad, somewhere to take notes as puzzles are solved
- `puzzles` 
	- the content varies, usually each file contains a list of sub-problems that had to be solved with a smattering of how everything was put together
- `templates`
	- files used as a base when creating new notes
- `wiki`
	- each file attempts to solve on a generic task; these tasks are typically glued together to solve a puzzle

> [!warning]
> These notes are NOT an attempt to outline each puzzle and the approach taken to solve it, and especially not a comprehensive tutorial. I do not expect anyone else to get any value from these notes. They exist to keep me organized and provide a historical log.
