# Advent of Code notebook

This directory contains notes I took while solving puzzles.

- The `journal` directory contains my thoughts/approaches over the course of the challenges, in the form of "daily notes".
- The `puzzles` directory contains a file for each puzzle; they are mostly empty.
- The `templates` directory contains templates; they are used as the base when creating new notes.

The docs are stuctured this way because I take notes using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which helps me streamline everything.
