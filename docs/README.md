- `journal` 
	- contents: files for each IRL day I attempted a puzzle
	- contains links to the puzzles attempted/solved on that day
- `puzzles` 
	- contents: files for each puzzle
	- each file acts as a scratchpad, a place to take notes as puzzles are solved
	- usually empty, but sometimes describes the approach taken
- `templates`
	- contents: files used as a base when creating new notes
- `wiki`
	- contents: files summarizing a solution for a generic task
	- these tasks are typically glued together to solve a puzzle

> [!warning]
> These notes are NOT an attempt to outline each puzzle and the approach taken to solve it, and especially not a comprehensive tutorial. I do not expect anyone else to get any value from these notes. They exist to keep me organized and provide a historical log.
