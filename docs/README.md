- `backup`
	- each file is a copy of the problem statement, taken directory from the AoC website
- `journal` 
	- each file acts as a scratchpad, somewhere to take notes as puzzles are solved
- `puzzles` 
	- the content varies, usually each file contains a list of sub-problems that had to be solved with a smattering of how everything was put together
- `templates`
	- files used as a base when creating new notes
- `wiki`
	- each file attempts to solve on a specific task, these tasks are typically glued together to solve a puzzle

The docs are stuctured this way because I take notes using [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which helps me streamline everything.
