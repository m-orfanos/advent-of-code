[[Day 04 Scratchcards]] part 2

[[Day 05 If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer]]

part 1

I wrote up a naive solution which passes the test but hangs for the puzzle ðŸ˜†. I basically created a map for each source<->destination attribute and traversed through them as needed. Looking at the real input, this was a really bad approach as the range numbers are pretty big.

I will have to think of another approach.

It turns out the "optimized" solution is much more simple than my naive approach, at least conceptually.
