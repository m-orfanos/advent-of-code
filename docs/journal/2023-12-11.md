[[Day 04 Scratchcards]] part 2

[[Day 05 If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer]]

Part 1

I wrote up a naive solution which passes the test but hangs for the puzzle ðŸ˜†. I basically created a map for each source<->destination attribute and traversed through them as needed. Looking at the real input, this was a really bad approach as the range numbers are pretty big.

I will have to think of another approach.

It turns out the "optimized" solution is much more simple than my naive approach, at least conceptually.

Part 2

Wow, this was so hard. It took me about seven hours to write something that worked with the example input (and immediately passed with the real input ðŸ’ƒ).

The two main breakthroughs were:

1) determine a fast method to calculate the intersection of two intervals
2) expand the mappings such that they cover a continuous range (e.g. no holes)

The first problem took me forever to figure out. I kept trying to split the interval and add missing parts on the fly, but I hit a wall with that approach.
