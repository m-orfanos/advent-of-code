[[Day 01 Trebuchet]]

Optimization 1

I don't need to use KMP, instead I can take advantage of the digits words lacking proper prefixes/suffixes and skip ahead where there's a mismatch. This will result in zero backtracking.

Optimization 2

Given a string input, I take one pattern (digit work, e.g. "one") and look for matches, both front and back. 

I need to keep track of the indices where matches were found. This way I can stop searching for matches in the next pattern when the tracked index is surpassed.

Optimization 3

When doing above, always check if the current character being matched is a digit.

(a few hours later)

I ended up using the build-in String methods `find` and `rfind` instead of rolling my own string-searching algorithm.

[[Day 02 Cube Conundrum]]

Nothing to note. The puzzle was pretty straightforward and I'm also getting more comfortable thinking in Rust(tm).
