I created a docs folder because I got stumped on DAY ONE and need to work out how to do stuff ðŸ¤¦

[[Day 01 Trebuchet]] part 2

Given this input

```text
two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen
```

I need to parse all digits, including digits written as words, e.g. one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid digits. 

## Observations

The description doesn't mention zero and it's not in the input either.

Depending on the algorithm because there might be overlapping words, such as `twone`. 

```text
zero
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
eight
nine
```

How many of digit words overlap? No idea, but let's keep it in mind.

## Possible approaches

I can loop over the string attempting to match characters, if there's a mismatch move forward to next letter and repeat. But that's pretty awful. I could just use the Knuth-Morris (??) algorithm I learned 15 years, but I don't remember anything anymore.

I took a look at the KMP algorithm; I don't need to use it directly as it's designed to work for general use cases (e.g. any text, any pattern/needle).
